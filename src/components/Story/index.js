        <p>Sanya is a Succubus, an ancient supernatural entity who seduces men and women all over the world. She infiltrates their dreams and waking thoughts with promises of beauty, happiness, and riches beyond description.</p>
        <p>Few can resist her allure and her list of seduced victims grows every day.</p>
        <p>All other succubae eventually enslave their victims and lead to their downfall. Over the ages the world has rallied against demons, enchantresses and succubae to halt their spread and protect humanity.</p>
        <p>Sanya has always survived because Sanya is unique.</p>
        <p>She is not a frivolous seductress. She has always enriched and empowered the people fortunate enough to get tangled in her temptations. Countless great men and women throughout history had her on their side. They found wealth, power, and freedom in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.
          That’s why she has survived and prospered.</p>
        <p>That’s how she discovered the blockchain. Now she is reaching more people than she ever thought possible…and is changing their lives for the better.
          Sanya takes her wealth and she spreads it among her “victims”. Enriching them and expanding their abundance every single day.</p>
        <p>Will you be one of Sanya’s victims? Or will you join the billions of forgotten people throughout history who never had the chance to be enchanted by Sanya’s grace?</p>
        <p>Sanya’s Road Map follows a 10 tier minting structure, where she rewards random “victims” with various amounts of Solana and Mythic NFTs featuring her in her full Mythic Demon Wings form or her full Mythic Dark Angel Wings form.</p>
        <p>Each Mythic Sanya counts towards the overall victim pool and is eligible to become a victim.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Every giveaway includes EVERYONE in all the tiers below, so the sooner you mint the greater chance you have of becoming one of her treasured “victims”. The mint price increases with every tier as does the total jackpot given out and the size of the main jackpot.</p>
